    <p>Hi I’m Matt. It is Saturday 14th November 2020. I’m building this website, which is a blog, on the go. I’ve had <a href="https://www.mattischrome.com">other blogs before</a> but right now the options for starting again are little overwhelming, never mind if you want to port over all your old posts.</p>

    <p>There is so much machinery with which you can build a website. Not all of it seems that necessary when starting from scratch, especially if you  want to type out your thoughts and fling them into the void (AKA 2020’s barren shadow of what the internet used to be).</p>
    
    <p>However, not all thoughts can be typed out. Some things have to be toyed with and explored. So it is my aim that this site will grow to accommodate those needs, and hopefully I can develop it from the ground up and flesh it out.</p>
    
    <p>I have a pen and paper list of things I want to make - I’ll type that up on the next update. For now I'll just say I need to present data in interesting and explorable ways.</p>
    
    <p>For now, this page is HTML and a tiny amount of CSS to make it look presentable. I used Guarav Koley’s post <a href="https://gaurav.koley.in/2019/339-bytes-of-responsive-css">339 bytes of responsive CSS</a> to get started. My CSS is smaller than that because I decided not to use a Google Font.</p>
    
    <p>So this page is one HTML file and one CSS file that lives together a GitHub repository and is served to Netlify. Simples. The next few posts I can add to this pretty easily, but after that I will have to start thinking about a site generator. Or will I? Let’s see how it goes.</p>
